# Pytorch-basics
## Pytorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment.
### This is the code snippets that I get to learn from this introductory tutorial : https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html
Download the required packages from here : https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ or try https://colab.research.google.com/
